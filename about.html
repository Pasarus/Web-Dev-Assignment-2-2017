		<h2>About page</h2>
		<p>I, first of all, created the index.html page and designed the original layout of the website (which was later redesigned), then I linked in the navigation (nav tag) bar with the webshop, WordPress and home pages. Then I moved onto converting my CV from pdf to HTML markup script and later onto this about page. I had a few issues when completing this assignment. For example, the nav bar would stay weirdly on the screen and it would just look odd, to fix this I used a new design of the website combined with extra CSS for the nav bar e.g.(height: 100%; position: fixed;). Other than that I have had few issues when completing this task which was not easily overcome with a google search of the issue. One trick I used was to make it so my nav bar and main body actually scaled with the size of the browser, not to the point where it would work on a mobile phone, but it was made so it wouldn't look out of place in a half sized browser window. I validated my CSS perfectly, then the HTML had an issue where I had made the lists incorrectly in my cv.html, by using ul tags inside other ul tags, which was fixed by using the end li tag after the second ul tag to allow for double-nested loops.</p>

		<p>One thing I found was that when I was looking at whether or not my HTML/CSS would work in all browsers was when I happened upon an older internet explorer install on my laptop, was that it didn't work for the most part. I believe this to be the browser struggling to display HTML5 in the browser and not a fault of my script markup. It, however, worked perfectly on Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, meaning that any person viewing in a modern browser would have no problems with the website that has been designed.</p>

		<p>Another thing that I did which I wouldn't have done for the CV is that the CSS was supposed to stay in the same file, what has happened because of it is the CSS is clogged and may be harder to actually work with when doing maintenance, the CV has been cleared up to minimise the CSS clogging but even with this there are a lot of things which would be better to be in a different CSS file.</p>

		<p>Due to the email on Friday 31st, I removed the Javascript by commenting it out you can see that it somewhat worked in the first place.</p>
